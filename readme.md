# Tracky

This is a little chrome extension I did to track my time. The main goal was to be able to easily create new project and track time for each task. Thanks to chrome.storage.sync API datas are automatically shared accress chrome instances that use the same account.

## Demo

I added support for localstorage and you can try the prototype directly from GitHub [here](http://rawgit.com/Grafikart/tracky/master/popup.html).

## Download for chrome

This extension can be downloaded from [chrome webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tracky/nopncmbjiejagfhpkcbdikogbjcjhhll?hl=fr)

## Todo

- Create a task to zip the thing (easier to publish)
- Changing currency
- Add a button to delete a project without having to delete every tasks in it
- Idea, generate invoices using the datas from project, the invoice would be editable and printable
